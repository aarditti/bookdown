# Overview

I am mapping woody debris (LW) over time in stream channels following wildfire. This spatial and temporal dataset will be applied in conjunction with geomorphic features to determine the location of sediment routing bottlenecks and which watersheds are more connected. These results will also be compared to an existing post-fire sediment routing model.
