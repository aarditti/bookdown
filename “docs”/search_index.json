This spatial and temporal dataset will be applied in conjunction with geomorphic features to determine the location of sediment routing bottlenecks and which watersheds are more connected. These results will also be compared to an existing post-fire sediment routing model. 1.2 Project Background This shows my bookdown document for my Reproducible Data Science Class. I am a graduate student at Utah State University in the Watershed Sciences Department The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/.

These 18 sites have been selected on the basis of having variable slope steepness, coniferous cover and burn severity. Satellite Imagery: This consists of Google and Hexagon available aerial imagery that will be used for analysis.Imagery was taken at different points along a 10 year period and varies in resolution and extent. LW (large wood) dataset: LW features (jams and individual logs) will be stored in this dataset.Attributes of features will be recorded based on the aerial imagery and context of the burn severity as well as the valley bottom. 2.2 Database Structure LW (large wood) data will be collected for each fire based on available satellite imagery in different years. Each temporal point will consist of an LW dataset and these datasets will be compiled for each fire to comprise a database.
